# README

This is a standard bootcamp project that I worked on to test out my basic understanding of routes and controllers in rails, as well as rudimentary CSS.

# Features

This is a website that allows the user to create a list of favorited movies pulled out from an API.

* The user can create a customized list and is able to upload an image to be used for the list graphic.
* The create form has been implemented on the index page.
* The user is able to remove movies on each list.

# Future prospects

This is only a minor beginner's project, but this was where I started as of Novemeber 2021.
